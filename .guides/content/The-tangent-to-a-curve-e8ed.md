Suppose you have a function $ y=f(x) $ and you draw its graph. If you want to find the tangent to the graph of $f$ at some given point on the graph of $f$, how would you do that?

Let $P$ be the point on the graph at which want to draw the tangent. 

If you are making a real paper and ink drawing you would take a ruler, make sure it goes through $P$ and then turn it until it doesn't cross the graph anywhere else. If you are using equations to describe the curve and lines, then you could pick a point $Q$ on the graph and construct the line through $P$ and $Q$ (“construct” means “find an equation for”). 

This line is called a “secant,” and it is of course not the tangent that you're looking for. But if you choose $Q$ to be very close to $P$ then the secant will be close to the tangent. 

So this is our recipe for constructing the tangent through $P$: pick another point $Q$ on the graph, find the line through $P$ and $Q$, and see what happens to this line as you take $Q$ closer and closer to $P$. 

The resulting secants will then get closer and closer to some line, and that line is the tangent. We'll write this in formulas in a moment, but first let's worry about how close $Q$ should be to $P$. 

We can't set $Q$ equal to $P$, because then $P$ and $Q$ don't determine a line (you need two points to determine a line). If you choose $Q$ different from $P$ then you don't get the tangent, but at best something that is “close” to it. Some people have suggested that one should take $Q$ “infinitely close” to $P$, but it isn't clear what that would mean. The concept of a limit is meant to solve this confusing problem.
